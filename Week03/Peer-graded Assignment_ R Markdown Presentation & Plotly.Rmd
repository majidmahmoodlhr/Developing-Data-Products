## Does the web page feature a date and is this date less than two months before the date that you're grading this assignment?

## Is the web page a presentation and does it feature an interactive plot that appears to have been created with Plotly?

```{r}
# Generate fictional data
set.seed(123)
hours_studied <- rnorm(50, 10, 3)
final_grade <- hours_studied + rnorm(50, 0, 2)

# Create the Plotly plot
plot_ly(x = hours_studied, y = final_grade, type = "scatter", mode = "markers") %>%
  layout(title = "Hours Studied vs. Final Grade",
         xaxis = list(title = "Hours Studied"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Final Grade"))
```
